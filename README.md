Diving into the depths of mathematics and computer science, this repository stands as a testament to the journey of solving computational and algorithmic challenges posed by [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). 

Leonhard Euler's name graces this venture not only for his enormous contributions to mathematics but for the spirit of curiosity that every problem solver possesses.

## üìò About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) offers a vast collection of challenges in the domain of computer science and mathematics. The problems range in complexity, encouraging users to optimize their solutions. A correct solution should ideally run in under a minute! However, for many, the joy isn't just in getting the right answer, but in the journey of discovery and learning.

## üîç Repository Structure

1. **driverProblems.py**: The main entry point for the project.
2. **problems.py**: Houses the algorithms and methods dedicated to solving the problems.
3. **solutions_test.py**: Contains `pytest` tests for each solution in `problems.py`.
4. **README.md**: Provides a comprehensive guide for users, contributors, and any curious minds. You're currently viewing it!
5. **LICENSE**: A file that stipulates the rights and restrictions associated with the project.

## üìä Problem Tracker

Here's a quick look at the problems we've tackled so far:

| Problem ID | Title                             |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| 001        | Multiples of 3 and 5             |
| 002        | Even Fibonacci numbers           |
| ...        | ...                              |

## üí° Commitment

I've undertaken a personal commitment to solve one problem every day. This Python repository is a sibling to the [project-euler-java-solutions](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/project-euler-java-solutions) repository, where I aim to solve the same problems but in Java.

## üìö Usage

To use this repository:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vishoTheEver/project-euler-py-solutions.git`
2. Navigate to the repository's directory: `cd project-euler-py-solutions`
3. Run `driverProblems.py` with Python to execute solutions: `python driverProblems.py`
4. For testing, make sure you have `pytest` installed. Run tests using: `pytest solutions_test.py`

## ü§ù Contributing
You are only able to access the discussion thread for a particular problem on Project Euler's official site once you have solved it. This ensures that every participant enjoys the thrill of discovery without any spoilers.

For those who've ventured into the realm of these problems and are looking for hints, methods, or simply wish to discuss the intricacies of a problem, the solution files in this repository might provide some insights. However, remember, as the great mathematicians would advocate, true understanding comes from the journey and not just the destination.

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! If you have solutions or optimizations to offer, feel free to open a pull request. Ensure you test your solutions using the provided test cases in `solutions_test.py`.
